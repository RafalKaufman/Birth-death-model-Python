# Modelling the birth-death model

Using python firstly I generated the Gaussian motion in order to later model the stochastic differential equation equivalent to the process, using the Euler-Mayorama scheme, the Milstein scheme as well as the Wagner-Platen scheme. In addition to that I estimated the convergence rate and expected value of the process.
