#Modelling the birth-death model

Using python I generated the Gaussian motion and modelled the stochastic differential equation equivalent to the process using the Euler-Mayorama scheme, the Milstein scheme as well as the Wagner-Platen scheme. In addition to that I estimated the convergence rate and expected value of the process.
